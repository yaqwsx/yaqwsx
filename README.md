Hi,

my name is Jan Mrázek, but nearly everyone calls me Honza. I am a programmer and
maker from the Czech republic.

I consider myself a “proper full-stack developer”. I can go anywhere from
designing a custom circuit on PCB, through programming of the microcontroller,
to the development of a desktop application up to running web services in the
cloud. If I need to, I can even program FGPA, though I don’t prefer to. I am
also not afraid of designing mechanical constructions, however, this rather a
hobby than something I was educated in and I am a master in. However, I know how
to run a mill, lathe, I can program a CNC machine or control a laser cutter.

Do you want to know what I can do? Then
